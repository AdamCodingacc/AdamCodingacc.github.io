  <h1>Further Discussion of Operational Issues</h1>
	<h2>Energy Usage</h2>
  <p>
		The most pressing issue of commercial MCF fusion reactors is the immense
		energy usage needed to ignite the reactor to sustain the plasma's critical
		temperature and pressure to have a likely probability of successful
		Deuterium Tritium fuel collision. An example of this is the <a href="./JET.html">JET reactor</a>
		-based at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, which has stated it requires
		700-800MW of energy <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> to create and sustain
		the conditions for fusion. Requiring  many specialised techniques and
		equipment, including:
		<ul>
			<li>Ohmic heating using a transformer to drive current through the plasma
				against the associated resistance with the plasma and cause heating in
				the same way a wire gets hot when a current passes through a metal.</li>
			<li>Injecting accelerated neutral atoms and via collisions with plasma
				ions transfers kinetic energy.</li>
			<li>Using beams of high energy microwaves that get absorbed by the plasma causing further heating.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		Through all of these techniques, the plasma in the core of the Tokamak has
		temperatures of up to 100x10^6 K, which needs to be confined from the
		reactor's vessel walls using superconducting magnets (an additional energy
		drain). When the reactor is at these required conditions, 80% of the energy
		per successful fusion process is from the production and acceleration of
		neutrons (the product of the reaction that will allow us eventually to
		produce electricity). In comparison, 20% goes towards the bi-product of the
		reaction, namely the production of a Helium atom. The problem with helium
		production and any energy gained in the fusion process is the Coulomb
		attraction between the positive protons in the helium atom and the
		dissociated electrons in the plasma, causing deceleration. To combat this,
		sustained energy input is needed. <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>
		<br><br>
		The reason for such large energy requirements, even for light element fusion
		reactions which would require the least amount of energy (i.e.
		Deuterium-Tritium reactions), comes from the fact that the nucleus has
		positively charged protons. If two positively charged particles are nearby,
		they always repel, called Coulomb repulsion. Because of this, D-T reactions
		require a 10KeV perfusion process (1:1 D-T atoms), which requires a
		temperature of ~10^8 K <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> for a likely
		probability of successful collision.
		<br><br>
		Another issue is that while it is theoretically possible to create net
		energy from a fusion reaction, this is only when the reactor is under
		pulsed loads. This is the technical term for when the reactor is undergoing
		nuclear fusion. However, for large amounts of time the reactor is idle and
		below the critical plasma temperature. During all of this, it is still
		consuming large amounts of energy needed to run secondary systems
		maintaining and analysing the reactor. These include:
		<ul>
			<li>Cryostats</li>
			<li>Vacuum pumps</li>
			<li>Ventilation</li>
			<li>Safety systems</li>
			<li>Instruments and sensors</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		The main issue with these secondary components is that they require
		alternative energy sources (called Auxiliary power using auxiliary systems.)
		The <a href="./ITER.html">ITER</a> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> reactor
		still requires 120MW for auxiliary systems and 500 MW under pulsed loads. It
		also states in the current stages of the project 200Mvar is required for
		pulsed loads and 48Mvar for continuous loads. Mvar is a measure of mega
		volt-amps, the power usage not being turned into work.
  </p>

	<h2>Radiation Damage to Components and People / Thermal Damage</h2>
	<p>
		As stated in the previous section, a fusion reaction aims to produce
		high-energy neutrons using Deuterium and Tritium as fuel, which, like a
		traditional power station, will heat a water bath to produce steam to be
		used as propulsion for a turbine.
		<br><br>
		The way that we obtain net energy out of this reaction is these high-energy
		neutrons. These will collide with the reactor vessel's side as, unlike the
		plasma/helium ions and electrons, neutrons have no charge so they are
		unaffected by the magnetic field that contains the plasma. The reactor's
		side is called a nuclear blanket, a sheet of metal that absorbs the
		accelerated neutrons' kinetic energy. In doing so, heat is transferred to
		the metal on impact. By then running a passive water system in contact with
		this, the water is heated and subsequently produces steam.
		<br><br>
		With this comes a major issue with reactors. These neutrons have energy in
		the range of 14Mev per neutron <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>. Such high
		energies can cause an issue as these neutrons can damage the reactor vessel
		through a myriad of processes <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>:
		<ul>
			<li>Thermally-induced defects weaken and crack plasma-facing materials
				(the vessel walls the plasma ring is enclosed in). The problem with the
				high-temperature variation of the inner vessel is fatigue caused by the
				expansion of the materials as temperature increases and the retraction
				as it is lowered. This potentially leads to issue's pressurising and
				sealing the reactor. Stress can induce cracking and weakening for
				continually operating the reactor under pulsed and idle loads.</li>
			<li>Oxidation of the heat sink can cause issues as a large amount of heat
				energy is in contact with a continual water stream. This leads to
				oxidation of the material and subsequently decreases the heat sink's
				thermal conduction making it a more inefficient process</li>
			<li>Neutron-induced degradation of the vessel walls via embrittlement.
				Embrittlement causes a loss in ductility of a material due to physical
				damage. (In our case, this is from the high-energy neutron collision,
				which leads to crack propagation). The most severe form of neutron
				degradation is transmutation, which is a form of nuclear bombardment.
				Weaknesses in the material are caused by stress tensors from the
				collision of neutrons with another material. It may cause the atom it
				collides with to form an isotope (1 additional neutron in the atom) with
				different properties to the original materials.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		If there are successful neutron collisions with instruments and components
		in the reactor, they become radioactive <sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>.
		Simultaneously, these do have a shorter half-life compared to nuclear fission
		waste, and the radioactivity per kg of fuel is smaller than fission<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>.
		However, the amount of waste produced is much more significant than in
		fission due to the fusion reactor requiring such high specification of its
		components and materials to function at such high temperatures.
		<br><br>
		Another consideration of these radioactive materials is for the people
		operating the nuclear reactors as prolonged exposure to these may pose
		issues such as radiation sickness or a higher risk of cancer if not properly
		managed.
		<br><br>
		This erosion of materials means that the reactor's expensive and fragile
		components could become compromised over time, leading to an inefficient or
		non-functioning reactor. Consequently, regular replacement of various
		components has to be done, which will severely increase the reactor's
		running cost. This setback means that commercial viability is unfeasible
		until this issue is resolved. In addition to this, the cost of properly
		disposing of this waste so that it does not lead to environmental damage is
		even greater.
	</p>

	<h2>Deuterium Tritium supplies</h2>
	<p>
		The most promising reactor fuel for viable fusion reactors is deuterium and
		tritium reactors (D-T reactor), which give a fusion neutron output 100x
		greater than D-D reactors <sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup>. Although the raw
		energy output from a single fusion process is much greater, there are
		several drawbacks:
		Deuterium production is abundant in nature, obtained from seawater<sup><a href="#10">[10]</a></sup>
		(called heavy water) through chemical processes to extract it from regular
		water and then further separated by electrolysis to obtain deuterium gas.
		This means that it is inexpensive and easy to manufacture at a large scale.
		<br><br>
		Tritium, however, is much more difficult. It is not found in abundance in
		nature like deuterium, mainly due to the fact it has such a short half-life
		of 12.3 years. With current figures, the world supply of Tritium is
		approximately 20kg. The issue is not only the limited supply, but that most
		of this comes from massive water extraction, much like deuterium extraction
		of heavy water, in the CANDU nuclear fission reactor, producing on average
		1.5 kg a year[6]. This means most of the material for clean fusion power is
		still coming from a highly polluting source. This is a real issue. It is
		emphasised by <a href="./ITER.html">ITER</a> saying that reactors running to
		produce net energy and feedback to the grid would require 300g of Tritium
		per day to produce 800 MW of electricity<sup><a href="#10">[10]</a></sup>.
		So one reactor running continuously would deplete a substantial amount of
		the world's supply on a daily basis.
		<br><br>
		One way that current fusion projects worldwide plan to tackle this is to
		introduce a breeding blanket, which is Tritium's production from high energy
		neutrons. These are present in the plasma colliding with lithium dosed panels
		in the shielding to make their fuel and become self-sufficient <sup><a href="#11">[11]</a></sup>.
		The problem with this is not a practical one but a commercial one.
		<br><br>
		The cost of this makes the fuel over $1420/g <sup><a href="#12">[12]</a></sup>,
		which is quite costly for a high-temperature breeder needed for commercial
		power production. This has a real impact on the commercial viability of the
		fusion produced electricity, as accounting for the inefficiencies of heat
		transfer, the initial energy needed to sustain nuclear fusion, and the
		relatively low collision rate of D-T atom with the high maintenance cost and
		fuel shortages at scale makes reactors costly when compared to alternative
		sustainable energy production methods.
	</p>
	<h2>Water Issues</h2>
	<p>
		Having already discussed the role water plays as a means of energy production,
		we can now move onto another critical function being a coolant. This means
		water is used to remove excess heat from auxiliary systems needed for the
		reactor to function effectively. For example, in the current <a href="./ITER.html">ITER facility,</a>
		water is used for both these purposes and is sourced from the Canal de
		Provence in addition to cooling towers. The problem is when ITER is
		operational; it requires 12 cubic meters per second to supply the reactor<sup><a href="#x">[x]</a></sup>.
		The implications of such demands mean any plans to commercialise fusion
		reactors and to build many such systems worldwide would need to be located
		near a large body of fresh water. This demand has the potential to cause
		problems, especially in areas with high levels of drought and limited
		drinking water.
		<br><br>
		In 2014 the university of California did a study on the implications and
		limitations of using water in fusion power cores and found multiple issues
		including<sup><a href="#y">[y]</a></sup>:
		<ul>
			<li>Untreated freshwater having a relatively 'Low thermal conversion
				efficiency of 33%' leading to higher cost of electricity in fusion applications.</li>
			<li>Using water in contact with breeding blankets at such high operating
				temperatures leads to various chemical reactions. Examples such as solid
				 breeding blankets containing beryllium (for neutron multiplication) can
				 react to produce beryllium oxide and hydrogen gas which is highly combustible
				 (also true for lithium doped materials, another breeding technique).</li>
		</ul>
		The potential for a hydrogen gas build due to leaks could pose a hazardous
		and costly disaster if not properly managed. Furthermore, using high volumes
		of water near high energy neutrons causes another scenario in which they
		react to produce deuterium, which can then decay into tritium<sup><a href="#z">[z]</a></sup>.
		If this is left unprocessed and recycled back into the environment, it could
		contaminate drinking water supplies or cause harm to the environment — a
		problem initially associated with PWR fission reactors.
		<br><br>
		It should be noted that water has been used in all other commercial reactors
		up to date, including fission reactors, because it is cheap and easily
		accessible with an extensive industry infrastructure meaning sophisticated
		systems can be implemented with little issue. However, more research for its
		applications in fusion reactors is needed to solve the issues outlined above.
	</p>

	<h2>Public Opinion</h2>
	<p>
		There has been much political debate whether to develop nuclear fusion
		reactors, or whether it would be more useful to continue using fissile
		reactors. Unlike fission reactors, fusion reactors have non-toxic emissions
		and their costs of running, building and decommissioning are similar. There
		is no risk of a meltdown, like the 2011 Fukushima accident on a fissile
		reactor, and there is no risk of proliferation. Deuterium and tritium are
		sustainable sources unlike the world’s dwindling supply of fossil fuels, and
		gram for gram, nuclear fusion produces 4 million times more energy than
		fossil fuel.
		<br><br>
		Unfortunately, as Figures 1, 2 and 3 below show us, in recent years there
		have been a somewhat negative opinion on using nuclear energy commercially.
		Although the figures below only compares the UK with Hungary (who currently
		meet 50% of their electricity needs by producing nuclear energy) [12], there
		is a general global consensus that people are beginning to disfavour the use
		of nuclear energy. The UK Long Term Nuclear Energy Strategy (Department of
		Energy and Climate Change, DECC, 2013) considers nuclear energy next to
		renewables, as well as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (DECC, 2013 p.5) as
		fundamental energy sources for the National Grid; with nuclear having the
		potential to deliver up to 75GW of the UK’s energy consumption. 14 of the
		current 15 fissile reactors will soon expire and will need to have their
		life cycle extended - however the replacement of ageing plants will require
		significant development of nuclear energy capacities. The nuclear development
		program and the installation of new nuclear power stations rely heavily on
		the involvement of French, Chinese, Korean and Japanese technology and financing.
		Unlike many other European countries, the Fukushima accident of 2011 has had
		no (significant) impact on government nuclear policies regarding nuclear
		energy. There has, however, been a global trend since 2011, in tightening
		security standards, a more thorough risk analysis process and the consequent
		rise in planning, financing, building and operational costs. Of 17 pieces of
		research overviewed by a british Parliament Committee, the majority showed
		clear - but conditional - support to using nuclear energy, 8 of the 17
		highlighted a much divided opinion of the public, and a further 6 of 17
		refused its extended use. There is hope that the UK’s Hinkley Point C
		Project [13] will change the general public perception of nuclear energy as
		a whole, despite the growing concern over the involvement of French and
		Chinese companies such as EDF, Areva and Chinese CGNPC.
	</p>
	<h2>Redundancy?</h2>
	<p>
		Britain has to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and some argue that
		investment in fusion is not the best way to achieve this, and instead the
		government should fund the mass deployment of wind and solar energy. One
		time chair of the ITER council, Sir Chris Lleqellyn Smith, has said: <em>"The
		cost of renewables has shot down while the cost of the world fusion project,
		<a href="ITER.html">ITER</a> has gone up”</em> [1]. Although Smith does highlight
		that even countries like Canada that have large amounts of renewables
		require alternate energy sources to meet the energy needs of the country, he
		said <em>“we need a carbon free source of energy that can complement renewables
		in the future”</em> [1]. Wind and solar energy are both dependent on environmental
		conditions, while fusion can be controlled to meet demand and has the
		potential to produce large amounts of energy. Despite a larger initial
		investment in commercialising fusion energy, it has many benefits with
		abundant fuels, no radioactive waste and no CO2 emissions.
		<br><br>
		ITER’s website claims that <em>“the ideal future energy mix for the planet would
		be based on a variety of generation methods instead of a large reliance on
		one source”</em> [2] and that fusion would make a “positive contribution” [2] to
		the challenges faced by alternative energy sources.
