	<h1>Current Fusion Methods</h1>
	<h2>Intro to fusion physics</h2>
	<p>
			Nuclear fusion reactions occur to combine light atomic nuclei, releasing
			energy in the process. To overcome the natural electrostatic repulsion
			between the reaction nuclei they have to reach extremely high temperatures
			(millions of degrees) to form a plasma. There are multiple methods for
			creating and forming this plasma currently being tested.
	</p>

	<h2>Inertial Confinement Fusion (<strong>ICF</strong>)</h2>
	<p>
		This type of nuclear fusion attempts to initiate a fusion reaction by heating
		up and compressing a fuel target (in the form of a pellet). These
		pellets will be compressed to incredibly high densities and temperatures
		so that fusion occurs for a short period of time (in the region of nanoseconds)
		until they blow apart.
		To achieve this compression high intensity lasers or
		beams of charged particles (<strong>a driver</strong>) are aimed at the outer layer
		of the target. The heated outer layer will explode, producing a reaction
		force which acts on the remaining fuel. This compresses it via shockwaves which
		are sufficiently powerful to compress and heat the fuel enough for fusion.
		This method of energy delivery can be direct or indirect depending on the
		setup and in its final stages can compress the pellet in the region of
		<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">1000 to 10,000 times the density of a typical solid.</a>
		<br><br>
		Direct delivery is when the laser is shone <em>directly</em> onto the surface
		of the fuel pellet. Indirect drive is when the laser is shone onto another
		object called a hohlraum (a gold cavity) which contains the pellet. It then vaporises bathing
		the fuel in X-rays, compressing it and starting fusion. This method is used
		at NIF (<em>National Ignition Facility</em>), the largest example of an ICF
		currently operational, as it prevents <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.871025">hydrodynamic instability</a>
		by uniform exposure.
		<br><br>

		The fuel target generally consists of a mixture of deuterium and tritium.
		Pellets of fuel are normally around <a href="https://www.iop.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/inertial-confinement-lancaster.pdf">10 mg</a>
		and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement#ref256088">1 to 10 mm in diameter</a>.
		To be efficient the time the pellet is burning must be less than the time for
		disassembly. To have this condition met, <em>compressed pellet mass density x radius</em>
		must be greater than 3 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. This helps because a large mass
		density hastens the burning of the pellet and a larger radius decreases the
		disassembly time. In order to be worthwhile the ratio of energy produced to
		driver energy recquired (<strong>pellet gain</strong>) has to be over
		<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">100.</a>
	</p>
	<h3>Issues with ICF</h3>
	<p>
	</p>
	<h3><a href="https://firstlightfusion.com/">First Light Fusion</a></h3>
	<p>
		First light fusion have tried to use a "<em>pistol shrimp mechanism</em>."
		This draws back the hammer part and then snaps to the opposite claw creating
		a rapid pressure change which causes vapor-filled voids in water. These are
		called cavitation bubbles which collapse to produce shock waves. Vapor is
		compressed so forcefully that it causes plasma to form – earth’s only natural
		example of ICF. Plasma formed in this way reaches temperatures of around
		<a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph240/nag2/">4,800 °C.</a>
		First light fusion are trying to use this design for a reactor to be the
		shockwave in ICF. It is intended to trigger the fusion reaction by creation
		of inertially confined plasma.

	<h2>Magnetic Confinement Fusion (<strong>MCF</strong>)</h2>
	<p>
		MCF is the other most common method of fusion and the most highly developed
		currently. <a href="./Tokamak.html">Tokamaks</a> are the main example in
		current use such as the one being built at <a href="./ITER.html">ITER</a>
		and the one at <a href="./JET.html">JET.</a> MCF uses magnetic fields to
		contain the fuel in the form of a hot plasma. It uses the conductivity of
		plasma to control it through the way it interacts with external magnetic
		fields. Pressure from magnetism is used to counteract that which originates
		from the plasma to try and hold the fuel with as little turbulence and leaking
		effects as possible.
		<br><br>
		There are two main types of MCF reactor: Magnetic mirror devices and Toroidal
		machines. Mirror devices generate non-planar fields generated by solenoids
		in which the strength of the field is raised at either end. As charged particles
		approach either end of the magnetic field they are reflected to keep them
		contained. Unfortunately, particles which are moving too fast along the field
		cannot be stopped by the mirror and escape leading to large leaking effects.
		Sections of plasma can be added at either end past the 'mirror' to reduce the
		leaking via the electrostatic potential barrier they produce. These are called
		end plugs, providing electrostatic plugging. This set up is called a "tandem
		 mirror" design but it is not perfect. In fact this design did not prove
		 fruitful and little work has been carried out in this field since the 1970s.
		 <br><br>
		 Currently, the most popular method are Toroidal machines, of which
		 <a href="./Tokamak.html">Tokamaks</a> are the most widespread example.
	</p>

	<h3>Stellarator</h3>
	<p>
		Stellarators are an example of MCF and more specifically a toroidal machine.
		Unlike <a href="Tokamak.html">Tokamaks</a> a stellarator is axially asymmetric
		and should eliminate most of the particle drift which is an issue in tokamaks.
		It is comprised of spiralling ribbon shapes which produce high-density plasma
		which is symmetric and more stable than tokamaks allowing for a longer running
		duration. Geometry makes these difficult to build and highly sensitive. The
		original shape was two half Torus shapes so the drift up on the inside edge
		of the tube and down on the outside edge will cancel out. There are issues
		with this however as it can cause collisions hence the revised shape.
	</p>

	<h2>Magnetized Target Fusion (<strong>MTF</strong>)</h2>
	<p>
		Combining MCF and ICF results in magnetized target fusion. A fusion fuel is
		confined at a lower density by magnetic fields and heated to become plasma.
		Fusion reactions are initiated by rapidly squeezing this fuel target to
		greatly raise the density and temperature. The result is at a far lower density
		than those of ICF and theoretically it will combine longer confinement times
		and better heat retention than the previous two methods.
		<br><br>
		One example of this is <a href="https://generalfusion.com/subsystems-fusion-energy-technology/">General Fusion's MTF reactor</a>
		which is comprised of 3 main components. Firstly, the plasma injector turns
		hydrogen fuel into hot plasma confining it in a magnetic field. Next, there
		is a chamber of spinning liquid metal which is used to compress the plasma
		as well as capturing the energy produced by the fusion reactions. A
		compression system is used to pump the liquid metal and form a vortex.
		Finally, a group of pistons are used in order to collapse the vortex,
		compressing the plasma further in the process. These pistons have to strike
		as close as possible to the same time as each other to create a symmetrical
		shockwave to interact with the fuel. To obtain energy from this the liquid
		metal wall is pumped through a heat exchanger to turn a steam turbine similar
		to traditional power plants.
	</p>

	<h3>Problems with MTF</h3>
	<p>
		One of the key issues is keeping plasma stable so it keeps its heat and lasts
		long enough to be able to be compressed.
	</p>

	<h3>Field-reversed Configuration (<strong>FRC</strong>)</h3>
	<p>
		FRC is used for magnetized target fusion. It is a device which confines
		the plasma on closed magnetic field lines without a central penetration so
		that it is a self-stable torus shape. The plasma is confined in it's own
		magnetic field by inducing a toroidal electric current in a plasma cylinder.
		This method is similar to spheromaks except that they have an internal
		toroidal field. (Spheromaks are essentially a spherical tokamak without a
		central conductor or magnet.) Field-reversed configuration is less prone to
		instabilities in theory but sturggles to make a sufficiently dense and
		stable plasma in practice.
