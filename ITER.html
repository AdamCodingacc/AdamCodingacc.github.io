	<h1>ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor)</h1>
	<h2 id="Intro">What is ITER?</h2>
	<p>
	The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, is the world’s
	first nuclear fusion power plant experiment. It aims to be complete with its
	reactor ready for commercial use by 2040. The design incorporates a <a href="./MCF.html#Tokamak">tokamak</a>
	- an experimental machine in which the energy produced in the fusion reaction
	is absorbed as heat in the walls of the vessel. This heat will produce steam,
	which will turn a turbine and generate electricity. Inside the tokamak is a
	doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber, where gaseous hydrogen becomes a plasma under
	immense pressures and temperatures. The plasma itself can be controlled by
	magnetic coils surrounding the vessel; in basic terms, the ITER experiment is
	just experimenting with this magnet to maximise energy output of the reactor.
	The tokamak has been experimentally adapted since the late 1960s, however ITER
	will be the world’s largest tokamak.

	<h3 id="Aims">Aims</h3>
	<p>
		There are five main objectives of ITER:
		<ol>
			<li><strong>To produce 500MW of power</strong> -i.e. achieve 10 times as much energy output as its input.</li>
			<li><strong>To demonstrate the integrated operation of technologies for a fusion power plant </strong>
				- scientists will be able to study plasmas and explore technologies such as heating, control, diagnostics, cryogenics and remote maintenance.</li>
			<li><strong>Achieve a deuterium-tritium plasma in which the reaction is sustained through internal heating</strong>
				- exploring a BPX (burning plasma experiment) where the heat from the fusion reaction is confined within the plasma efficiently enough for the reaction to be sustained for a long duration.</li>
			<li><strong>Test tritium breeding </strong>- the world supply of tritium
				(used with deuterium in the fusion reaction) is insufficient and a
				later-stage target of ITER is to be able to produce its own tritium.</li>
			<li><strong>Demonstrate the safety characteristics of a fusion device</strong>
				 - a primary goal is to demonstrate the control of the plasma and fusion
				  reactions with negligible consequences to the environment.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h2 id="curr">Current Status and Strategy</h2>
	<p>
		ITER is critical in the research and development of using nuclear fusion
		power plants to create electrical energy commercially. The facility, which
		is situated at St.Paul-lez-Durance in the Cadarache Valley in southern France,
		is one of many current nuclear energy production sites, many of which include
		current nuclear fission power plants which are used commercially <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. The
		partners in ITER have implemented extensive research and discovery across a
		range of science and technology fronts in the design of the tokamak - this
		will allow the development (and eventually the achievement) of the project’s
		engineering and fusion plasma performance requirements. Significant
		developments have been made, such as developments in superconducting magnet
		technologies and in producing the high-performance superconducting strand
		niobium-tin (Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn). In inner components subject to high heat
		flux are capable of sustaining quasi-stationary heat loads of up to 10 MW/m<sup>2</sup>
		and transient loads of up to 20MW/m<sup>2</sup>.

		ITER’s ambitious goal is to aim for a power output of as much as 700MW - i.e.
		the equivalent of 2.481020 14-MeV neutrons per second to give an uncollided
		flux of 41013n cm-1s-1. It is essential that ITER has an efficient Nuclear
		Analysis Strategy in place, which will involve meeting state regulations
	 	regarding radiation dosage limitations and other safety measures. To
	 	ensure all components are functioning correctly there must be sufficient
	 	shielding in place. This is due to the fact that several of the diagnostics
	 	(with machine protection and plasma control) are embedded in the inner
	 	machine component and ensure a high nuclear and electromagnetic load for
		long periods of time, hence they have reduced maintainability compared to
	 	the diagnostics in the ports. <a href="#table">Table 1</a> below shows how they are <strong>directly</strong>
		affected by not only nuclear heating / mechanical effects from lattice damage
		/ transmutation, but also by several <strong>indirect</strong> radiation effects.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>
		It is important that the diagnostics are robust and have a highly effective
		capability required for routine and reliable diagnostic operations.
		<br><br>
		Upon decommissioning, ITER has a responsibility to reduce the volume and
		radio-toxicity of its waste. It is believed that it will take over 30 years
		to complete construction operation and the decommissioning of the plant. <sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>
		<br><br>
		Chapter 12 of the Fusion Science and Technology Journal <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> considers generic
		issues affecting the diagnostics in a BPX which are directly or indirectly
		caused by the radiation environment. These issues become an important factor
		in the choice of machine and diagnostic layout, construction and maintenance.
		Issues such as nuclear radiation effects on specific components
		(e.g. cables), as well as thermal and mechanical degradation issues, must
		be addressed. It is much more difficult to replace inner components that
		have been subject to wear and tear by particle bombardment so in-situ
		mitigation techniques are required. Recalibration is also more difficult for
	 	the same reasons. It is important for BPX to enable the design of future
		power plants - the development needs for diagnostics are assessed.
		<br><br>
		The implementation of the French Order of 7th February 2019 <sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup> regarding
		INB (a French acronym for Basic Nuclear Installation) within the EU-DA
		(European Union Domestic Agency), and specifically on the EC-UL (Electron
		Cyclotron Upper Launcher), which is used to heat and control the plasma. The
		launcher includes both the port plug and the related in-vessel terms (such
		as the nuclear shielding, blanket module and optics), and the ex-vessel
		first confinement items (such as the diamond window, isolation valve,
		waveguides, miter bends, tapers and port plug back end).
	</p>

	<h2 id="future">Future Plans</h2>
	<p>
		Technologies such as tritium breeding (that is, sustainably creating their
		own supply of tritium) and remote maintenance (i.e. fixing inner machine
		diagnostic components subject to wear and tear) require further research and
		development. The need for robust safety and hardware protection has been
		addressed via the control system. <a href="./Issues.html">(Further Discussion)</a>
		<br><br>
		After the ITER project has successfully managed to commercially produce an
		output with a Q factor of 10 (for every 50MW of power supplied to the reactor,
		500MW is produced), Korea will launch its K-Demo, which is essentially a
		copy of ITER with the aims of testing larger scale power production and a
		power output of Q factor 30-50. The machine is simpler with fewer diagnostics
		and its purpose will be to demonstrate the feasibility of using nuclear
		fusion as an efficient and sustainable method to generate electrical energy
		for the world’s ever-growing population. Construction is expected to take
		place in the 2030’s and it is expected to run a continuous (or
		near-continuous) steady-state commercial operation in the 2040’s.

	<h3 id="politics">Political Issues</h3>
	<p>
		The loss of the UK’s membership to the European Atomic Energy Community
		(Euratom), as a result of exiting the European Union (EU), will result in
		loss of access to ITER. There is great uncertainty as to what role the UK
		will play in the involvement in ITER due to the loss of this membership. 90%
		of each member’s contribution is ‘in-kind’ equipment (as opposed to direct
		payments), other 10% is ‘in cash’ to fund the ITER budget.
	</p>
	<h3 id="inter">Working Internationally</h3>
	<p>
		Extensive research has been carried out into how globalisation trends affect
		our diversity and subsequently our cultures and our languages. It has been
		proven that multicultural organisations are more creative, more responsive
		to change and better suited to rapid changes in societies and economies. We
		seek to replace our current “corporate culture”; in which our only language
		used internationally is English; with a more multicultural and multilingual
		business environment, often referred to as the ‘learning organisation of the
		future”. As humans, we learn each other’s values, customs and beliefs - this
		necessitates the RICH (respect, interaction, curiosity and humility)
		guidelines in which we aim to one day replace our corporate culture with.
		In order to do so, it is important that the committee all receive
		professional training so that new ideas and approaches benefit everyone. The
		4 year experience of Agence ITER France runs an ILLP (International Language
		Learning Program), as a result of its involvement with 29 different
		nationalities and over 40 different languages. It explores how newly
		recruited staff are trained to accommodate a multicultural and a multilingual
		environment.
