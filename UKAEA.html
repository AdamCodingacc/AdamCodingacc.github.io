	<h1>UKAEA</h1>
	<p>
		The UKAEA (<em>United Kingdom Atomic Energy authority</em>) are a branch of
		the government dedicated to delivering nuclear fusion as a sustainable
		energy source. They aim to bring the UK to the front line being world leaders
		in nuclear fusions development, creating jobs and sustainable energy in the
		process.
		<br><br>
	</p>
	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>
		Culham centre for Fusion Energy (<strong>CCFE</strong>) is one of the world's
		leading fusion research laboratories. It is run by the UKAEA and host to
		<a href="./JET.html">JET</a> which has set world records for plasma performance
		since operations began in 1983. It is operated in conjunction with the
		European Commission (managed by the EUROfusion consortium.) MAST
		(<em>Mega Amp spherical tokamak</em>) also operates out of Culham,
		researching upgrades to tokamak reactors in the form of a new style of divertor.
		This should be capable of managing the power load of a tokamak instead of
		needing periodic replacement after being worn down inducing large operation
		costs.
		<br><br>
		Furthermore, the UKAEA run several facilities and programs out of Culham and
		surrounding areas to train young and new people in the field such as OAS
		(Oxfordshire advanced skills), a training centre for Oxfordshire businesses
		to offer engineering apprenticeships. They also run a Materials Research
		Facility aimed at both University and Industry users and RACE (remote applications
		in challenging environments facility) for Research and Development in the
		robotics field.
		<br><br>
	</p>
	<h3>STEP</h3>
		<p>
		The main project being worked on currently by UKAEA is the Spherical Tokamak
		for energy production (<strong>STEP</strong>) facility. This is a UK based
		fusion power station currently being planned and conceptualized. UKAEA aims
		to have the reactor producing a net gain of energy by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority/about">
		2040</a> and are operating on an inital budget of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority/about">
		Â£220 million</a> to design the reactor. It is currently unclear how much of
		this budget will be spent on construction and what the exact final cost of the
		project will be.
