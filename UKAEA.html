	<h1>UKAEA</h1>
	<p>
		The UKAEA (<em>United Kingdom Atomic Energy authority</em>) are a branch of
		the government dedicated to delivering nuclear fusion as a sustainable
		energy source. They aim to bring the UK to the front line of research and become
		world leaders in nuclear fusions development, creating jobs, sustainable
		energy and economic growth in the process. To do this they participate in
		many research projects, hosting most of them themselves. More recently this
		has included the <a href="https://www.namrc.co.uk/centre/ukaea-rotherham/">£22 million fusion research facility</a>
		under construction at the advanced manufacturing park in Rotherham. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
		<br><br>
	</p>
	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>
		Culham centre for Fusion Energy (<strong>CCFE</strong>) is one of the world's
		leading fusion research laboratories. It is run by the UKAEA and host to
		<a href="./JET.html">JET</a> which has set world records for plasma performance
		since operations began in 1983. It is operated in conjunction with the
		European Commission (managed by the EUROfusion consortium.) MAST
		(<em>Mega Amp spherical tokamak</em>) also operates out of Culham,
		researching upgrades to tokamak reactors in the form of a new style of divertor.
		This should be capable of managing the power load of a tokamak instead of
		needing periodic replacement after being worn down inducing large operation
		costs.
		<br><br>
		Furthermore, the UKAEA run several facilities and programs out of Culham and
		surrounding areas to train young and new people in the field such as OAS
		(Oxfordshire advanced skills), a training centre for Oxfordshire businesses
		to offer engineering apprenticeships. They also run a Materials Research
		Facility aimed at both University and Industry users and RACE (remote applications
		in challenging environments facility) for Research and Development in the
		robotics field.

	<h3>STEP</h3>
		<p>
		The main project being worked on currently by UKAEA is the Spherical Tokamak
		for energy production (<strong>STEP</strong>) facility. This is a UK based
		fusion power station currently being planned and conceptualized. UKAEA aims
		to have the reactor producing a net gain of energy by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority/about">
		2040</a> and are operating on an inital budget of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority/about">
		£220 million</a> to design the reactor. It is currently unclear how much of
		this budget will be spent on construction and what the exact final cost of the
		project will be.
