	<h1>UKAEA</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Introduction to the UKAEA</h2>
	<p>
		The UKAEA (<em>United Kingdom Atomic Energy authority</em>) are a branch of
		the government dedicated to delivering nuclear fusion as a sustainable
		energy source. They aim to bring the UK to the front line of research and become
		world leaders in nuclear fusions development, creating jobs, sustainable
		energy and economic growth in the process. To do this they participate in
		many research projects, hosting most of them themselves. More recently this
		has included the £22 million fusion research facility under construction at
		the advanced manufacturing park in Rotherham. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
	</p>
	<h2 id="investment">Investments from the UKAEA</h2>
	<p>
		On 27th June 2018 HM Government announced the <em>‘Nuclear sector deal’</em>
		which would aim to boost research and development in nuclear technologies and
		STEM in the UK. This deal included plans to raise research & development funding
		to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 and invest £725m into local innovation projects<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
		One of these projects is the £22m UKAEA fusion technology research facility
		currently under construction at the Advanced Manufacturing park (<strong>AMP</strong>)
		in Rotherham. The facility is being constructed by JF Vinnegan; a locally based
		design and construction firm and will be managed and funded by the UK Atomic
		Energy Authority. In addition to the promised funding packages provided by
		the Nuclear Sector Deal the project has also received guarantee of a £2m
		investment from Sheffield city’s local growth fund which aims to boost local
		business and allow for prosperous growth in the Sheffield city region. This
		investment is critical to allow the facility to complete its aim to develop
		and test joining technologies for fusion materials and components which can
		be tested under fusion conditions. This will, in turn, feed information and
		best practice to <a href="/ITER.html">ITER,</a> the international nuclear
		fusion test facility, to develop sustainable and mass-produced energy from
		nuclear fusion. Currently, local construction firms have completed the
		25,000 sq ft exterior shell of the facility which is ready to be handed over
		to the UKAEA who are to begin to collate researchers and maintenance staff
		with the aim of commencing operation in 2021. The facility is strategically
		placed in the advanced manufacturing park where it can work alongside the
		University of Sheffield and the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research
		Centre (NAMRC) as well as cooperating with the neighbouring Rolls Royce and
		Boeing facilites.
		<br><br>
		The investment and construction of this facility comes as the government
		pushes to rapidly develop carbon-neutral forms of energy production and
		efficient ways of using nuclear sources to generate power. This is not the
		only investment in research into this area provided by the UKAEA. In 2017
		the government announced an £86m investment to boost the UKAEA’s funding of
		a new fusion research programme at the Culham science centre which opened
		its doors this year. Another example of attention and large investment into
		the fusion sector is the government’s £220m investment in the UKAEA’s
		Spherical Tokamak for energy production (STEP) programme. These sudden
		investments came after a report was filed outlining the outcome and success
		of investment in nuclear fusion over the last decade. Clearly, the funding
		is available and increasing for not only energy production but in research
		and development as well.
		<br><br>
		In a press release published on 24th November 2020, the government has
		announced that for every £1 invested into developing fusion technology in
		the UK, £4 is returned to boost the British economy. Using this claim, it
		can be predicted that the government's £346.7m investment in nuclear fusion
		over the past decade will return £1.4bn to the economy. The fact that this
		funding is returning so prosperously to the economy shows that investing in
		fusion research is, in fact, beneficial to the taxpayer and an efficient
	 	sector. This will surely result in a future of increased funding being
	 	directed towards nuclear fusion, causing an acceleration of attention and
	 	progress in developing efficient nuclear power. As a result of this, the
		University of Sheffield should endeavour to involve itself in the
		progression of nuclear fusion as it begins to gain more traction. This
		would start by sharing expertise and involving itself in the UKAEA facility
		at the AMP. Furthermore, the Government has committed to developing
		‘Fusion-adjacent’ technologies such as robotics, computing and materials to
		work alongside direct fusion funding. This opens even more doors for the
		involvement of institutions like the University of Sheffield to enhance its
		current ongoing research in those areas as well as increasing work in the
		atomic and nuclear sectors.

	<h3 id="jobs">Jobs and Opportunities</h3>
	<p>
		Nuclear fusion has boosted the British economy by £1.4 billion, creating
		about 4,000 jobs a year <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Government investment in fusion has also
		produced a more skilled workforce, creating knowledge transfer between
		industries, benefitting robotics, artificial intelligence and the new
		material development. UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman said “Our mission
		is to lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy and maximise scientific
		and economic benefit.” <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
		<br><br>
		The new UKAEA facility in Rotherham will bring with it 40 new jobs <a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
		Chief executive officer of the Nuclear AMRC, Andrew Stoner, has said: “This
		development has the potential to create many jobs in the local supply chain
		as fusion technology matures. This is a huge deal for Sheffield and the
		North, and we are really pleased to have played a part in this and to be
		working with UKAEA” <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.  Ontop of job opportunities created by the
		facility itself, requirements for specialist materials at regular frequency
		demands the work of the local manufacturers, providing further employment
		opportunities for local companies. Mayor of Sheffield, Dan Jarvis, has said
		that this will cause “boosting the region’s economy and highlighting our
		world-leading specialisms in advanced manufacturing” <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
		The £2 million investment from the local Sheffield Growth Fund will help
		further improve the status of the Advanced Manufacturing Park as an area of
		high-value employment within the UK.

	<p>
		Culham centre for Fusion Energy (<strong>CCFE</strong>) is one of the world's
		leading fusion research laboratories. It is run by the UKAEA and host to
		<a href="./JET.html">JET</a> which has set world records for plasma performance
		since operations began in 1983. It is operated in conjunction with the
		European Commission (managed by the EUROfusion consortium.) MAST
		(<em>Mega Amp spherical tokamak</em>) also operates out of Culham,
		researching upgrades to tokamak reactors in the form of a new style of divertor.
		This should be capable of managing the power load of a tokamak instead of
		needing periodic replacement after being worn down inducing large operation
		costs.
		<br><br>
		Furthermore, the UKAEA run several facilities and programs out of Culham and
		surrounding areas to train young and new people in the field such as OAS
		(Oxfordshire advanced skills), a training centre for Oxfordshire businesses
		to offer engineering apprenticeships. They also run a Materials Research
		Facility aimed at both University and Industry users and RACE (remote applications
		in challenging environments facility) for Research and Development in the
		robotics field.

	<h3 id="step">STEP</h3>
		<p>
		The main project being worked on currently by UKAEA is the Spherical Tokamak
		for energy production (<strong>STEP</strong>) facility. This is a UK based
		fusion power station currently being planned and conceptualized. UKAEA aims
		to have the reactor producing a net gain of energy by 2040<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
		and are operating on an inital budget of £220 million<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
		to design the reactor. It is currently unclear how much of his budget will
		be spent on construction and what the exact final cost of the project will be.
