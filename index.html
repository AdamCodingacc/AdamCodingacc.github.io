  <h1>What to do with the UKAEA investment</h1>
	<h2 id="Intro">Introduction to fusion physics</h2>
	<p>
			Nuclear fusion reactions occur to combine light atomic nuclei, releasing
			energy in the process. To overcome the natural electrostatic repulsion
			(Coulomb Force) between the reaction nuclei, they have to reach extremely
			high temperatures (millions of degrees) to form a plasma. There are
			multiple methods for creating and forming this plasma currently being tested.
			The main fuel currently being tested for reactors consists of Deuterium and
			Tritium.
			<br><br>
			The fusion between deuterium and tritium (DT) nuclei produces one helium
			nucleus, one neutron, and great amounts of energy. The image [1] (below)
			illustrates DT (deuterium-tritium) fusion reactions, in which two very
			excited, very hot atoms with high energies collide, fusing into one atom
			and releasing leftover subatomic particles and energy.  The third atom
			produced from the DT reaction is extremely unstable and so it releases
			the extra neutrons (and leftover energy) in order to become stable again.

  <h2 id="curr">Current issues with fusion</h2>
  <p>
		Nuclear fusion processes can compromise the structural integrity of the
		materials encompassing the reactor vessel, leading to costly and dangerous
		consequences if not addressed. This not only is a problem in contemporary
		fusion facilities but also for plans of commercial reactors as high
		maintenance costs and downtime replacing vital components of the reactor can
		discourage further investment in this sector.
		<br><br>
 		These processes include Thermally-induced defects, Oxidation, Neutron-induced
		degradation\embrittlement and transmutation. Also, the risk of producing
		radioactive waste from these various high energy neutron interactions poses
		another problem with the production of clean and sustainable energy.
		<br><br>
		As it stands, no such material exists to date which is capable of withstanding
		all these effects under such strenuous conditions over a sustained period.
		This means that more research into this needs to be done.
  </p>


  <h2 id="UKAEA">What is the UKAEA?</h2>
  <p>
		The UK Atomic Energy Authority researches nuclear fusion and sustainable
		technologies with the goal of creating a sustainable future for the UK,
		benefiting the economy and the nations standing as a leader in nuclear
		energy.[2]
		<br><br>
		The new UKAEA facility will create many jobs for the local area in Sheffield,
		and the wider supply chain across the UK. It will be based in the Advanced
		Manufacturing Park (<strong>AMP</strong>) in Rotherham alongside the Advanced
		Manufacturing Research Centre (<strong>AMRC</strong>).
		<br><br>
		The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is a world-leading research
		centre based in Rotherham, with over 120 partners including Boeing,
		Rolls-Royce and Airbus. Run by the University of Sheffield, the AMRC will be
		home to the new £22m UKAEA facility and will focus research into finding
		suitable materials for fusion, joining techniques, and additive
		manufacturing. [3] At this new facility, the UKAEA aims to achieve commercial
		nuclear fusion by utilising cost effective and technical manufacturing to
		overcome the major issues preventing it. This may be done by using the above
		techniques and modularisation to efficiently manage sections of the whole
		design program.
  </p>



  <h2 id="Uni">How can the University get involved?</h2>
  <p>
		Primarily, research at the new UKAEA facility will consist of materials
		research and manufacturing research. Researchers may collaborate with the
		University of Sheffield’s department of material science and engineering
		where the aforementioned techniques are researched. The Physics department
		research largely does not overlap with this sector. This means that to
		effectively assist in the research carried out at the facility large changes
		would need to be made in the department which cannot be justified by the
		size of the current investment. In conclusion, it would be more advisable
		for the materials and engineering departments to assist in the research as
		it more directly connects with current studies in these fields.
