  <h1>What to do with the UKAEA investment</h1>
	<h2>Intro to fusion physics</h2>
	<p>
			Nuclear fusion reactions occur to combine light atomic nuclei, releasing
			energy in the process. To overcome the natural electrostatic repulsion
			(Coulomb Force) between the reaction nuclei, they have to reach extremely
			high temperatures (millions of degrees) to form a plasma. There are
			multiple methods for creating and forming this plasma currently being tested.
			The main fuel currently being tested for reactors consists of Deuterium and
			Tritium.
			<br><br>
			The fusion between deuterium and tritium (DT) nuclei produces one helium
			nucleus, one neutron, and great amounts of energy. The images [3] (below)
			illustrate DT (deuterium-tritium) fusion reactions, in which two very
			excited, very hot atoms with high energies collide, fusing into one atom
			and releasing leftover subatomic particles and energy.  The third atom
			produced from the DT reaction is extremely unstable and so it releases
			the extra neutrons (and leftover energy) in order to become stable again.

  <h2>Current issues with fusion</h2>
  <p>

  <h2>What is the UKAEA?</h2>
  <p>
		The UK Atomic Energy Authority researches nuclear fusion and sustainable
		technologies with the goal of creating a sustainable future for the UK,
		benefiting the economy and the nations standing as a leader in nuclear
		energy.[3]
		<br><br>
		The new UKAEA facility will create many jobs for the local area in Sheffield,
		and the wider supply chain across the UK. It will be based in the Advanced
		Manufacturing Park (<strong>AMP</strong>) in Rotherham alongside the Advanced
		Manufacturing Research Centre (<strong>AMRC</strong>).
		<br><br>
		The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is a world-leading research
		centre based in Rotherham, with over 120 partners including Boeing,
		Rolls-Royce and Airbus. Run by the University of Sheffield, the AMRC will be
		home to the new Â£22m UKAEA facility and will focus research into finding
		suitable materials for fusion, joining techniques, and additive
		manufacturing. [4]
