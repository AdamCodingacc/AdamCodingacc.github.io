  <h1>Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre</h1>

  <h2 id="Intro">Introduction to research done at the AMRC</h2>
  <p>
    AMRC is the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre run by the University of
    Sheffield. It performs general research as well as collaborating with specific
    companies to try and improve the manufacturing abilities of the world. It is
    the site the UKAEA has chosen to invest in a new facility in order to research
    nuclear related projects and manufacturing techniques.<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
    <br><br>
    In the new UKAEA facility, research will primarily consist of finding the
    right materials for nuclear fusion, joining techniques for materials,
    additive manufacturing (<strong>AM</strong>), advanced numerical simulation
    to predict component performance and improving codes and standards to make
    nuclear fusion commercially viable.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>
		<br><br>
		The NAMRC is working together with the UKAEA on the feasibility of modular
		construction techniques. Together, they are studying how the modularisation
		techniques used for current modular reactors could be applied to STEP. The
		research aims to reduce the risk in the manufacturing and construction stages
		of the reactor.
		<br><br>
		Finding the right materials for a commercial reactor is a
		difficult task. Conditions in the reactor walls reach temperatures of up to
		2000 degrees C. Refractory metals are the most suitable choice of materials,
		with melting points of 2000 degrees but there are many other requirements a
		suitable material must meet to be safely implemented in a reactor. The advanced
		analysis and assessment of material requires extremely sensitive equipment
		like graphene sensors. The new facility in the Advanced Manufacturing Park
		will carry out research testing various materials under the conditions in a
		nuclear reactor. Currently the new facility has been finished being built and
		the UKAEA is currently fitting it out, an official opening will be held when
		it is safe to do so.

  </p>

  <h2 id="Add">Additive Manufacturing</h2>
  <p>
    Additive manufacturing (<strong>AM</strong>), also known as 3D printing, will be heavily
    researched and used as a method of designing complex components needed for
    nuclear fusion<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>. The term for additive manufacturing comes from construction
    of materials, layer by layer. Some aircraft and spacecraft already make use
    of additive manufacturing for their components, whilst nuclear research mostly
    depends on materials developed decades ago. The Rotherham facility will be
    researching this technique for nuclear fusion. AM is still relatively new and
    will be key in designing components. This could be done in conjunction with
    the department of mechanical engineering and more specifically the Centre for
    advanced additive manufacturing (<strong>AdAM</strong>)<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>.
    <br><br>
    AM occurs by using a thin layer of powder metals (<em>~20-30 microns</em>) and
    dropping them onto a substrate. A laser or an electron beam is then used to melt
    the powder into fully formed components. Metal additive manufacturing is a
    better alternative to traditional manufacturing techniques as using this
    process saves time and money. Furthermore, the components are designed in a
    software of your choice, layer by layer, giving engineers a better understanding of
    the materials and components being made and more customisability to make bespoke materials.
    This is a quick process, where engineers can have the component produced in
    a matter of hours. This significantly reduces the time requirements in the
    whole process of designing and testing materials. In turn this is better
    for making alterations to parts produced as more traditional methods
    will be more costly to make changes to the design. This is because the tools
    (<em>casts</em>) are made specifically for that component.
    <br><br>
    With AM, you can optimize the structure more efficiently. The difference in
    cost between complex and simple components is not overly significant. This has
    had practical applications in aviation by reducing the mass of components in
    the aircraft, hence lowering the amount of fuel needed to carry the craft.
    Nuclear fusion can benefit from the ability to design more complex components
    easily as each reactor is a bespoke facility and therefore does not greatly
    benefit from traditional mass manufacturing.
		<br><br>
		At the advanced manufacturing research centre (AMRC), a 3D woven composite
		component is currently being developed alongside the UKAEA<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>. They set out
		to design a component that could withstand 600 degrees celsius and using
		additive manufacturing were able to produce a complex component that met the
		design specifications using silicon carbide. When the new facility is running,
		this is the research that will be carried out. Standard manufacturing routes
		are struggling to meet the requirements to achieve commercial fusion thus
		newer manufacturing routes have to be researched to achieve this.

  <h3 id="Powder">Powder Production</h3>
  <p>
    For additive manufacturing, we need to use powder metals. The University of
    Sheffield department of materials science and engineering is a founding part
    of the Henry Royce Institute where research involves that into powder
    production<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>. They research several methods, such as gas atomisation, it
    produces spherical powders from titanium, iron etc. This method is useful
    for powder production as the method is inert and can produce powders from
    titanium alloys and refractory metals, which are  metals with high temperatures
    (>2000 degrees celsius) amongst other useful properties.
    <br><br>
    Plasma Spheroidisation is also researched which uses high energy plasma to
    produce highly spherical and dense powders. It provides consistent results
    and these powders have better flowability inside an AM machine, reducing
    production time.
    <br><br>
    Attrition milling is also researched at the University of Sheffield, a more
    general technique for powder production. It is more appropriate for mid-range
    sized particles such as carbon steel, stainless steel, chrome and tungsten.
    At the UKAEA facility they could work with the University of Sheffield to find
    appropriate methods for powder production for the additive manufacturing needs
    for nuclear fusion.

  <h2 id="Join">Joining Techniques</h2>
  <p>
    Another avenue of research at the centre, will be joining techniques for
    materials. Particular interest is in advanced power beam welding techniques,
    such as electron beam welding and laser welding. This is in comparison to
    manual arc welding, which is commonly used as in most design nuclear design
    codes. The UKAEA hopes to explore techniques like this to innovate manufacturing
    technologies in the facility being constructed at the AMRC.
  </p>
  <h3 id="weld">Electron Beam Welding</h3>
  <p>
    Electron beam welding for example is much more efficient than manual arc welding.
    An electron beam is emitted from a cathode in a vacuum. These electrons are
    accelerated via a voltage and focused using an electromagnetic coil. These
    electrons transfer heat when they collide with the surface of the material in
    question. Manual arc welding uses arc discharge to weld materials. A voltage
    is applied to 2 electrodes, this voltage is increased until the dielectric
    breakdown of air between the electrodes, this emits heat and light which is
    used to weld the material. With electron beam welding, the beam is more
    intense than arc welding. It has approximately a 1000 times greater energy
    density with the heat applied to the surrounding areas being low, hence
    reducing distortion to the material. The output of the electron can be adjusted,
    allowing electron beam welding to be useful for a large selection of materials.
    <br><br>
    Although electron beam welding is easier to control and more efficient, it
    requires a vacuum. There has been interest in local vacuum chambers so as to
    not vacuum the whole assembly of components but rather sections of it. More
    recently, there have been some electron beam welding machines capable of
    welding in a low vacuum. Research at the AMRC could look into this to help
    improve the feasibility of a commercial nuclear fusion reactor by reducing
    production costs and reducing distortion to create more precisely shaped
    components. This will have a secondary effect of increasing the safety of
    reactors too.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Bond">Bonding Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    Materials which are dissimilar to each other will have to be joined and for this
    solid state bonding techniques will be used and researched at the centre. Such
    techniques as diffusion bonding, ultrasonic welding, magnetic pulse welding
    and hot isostatic pressing can be looked into. Diffusion bonding relies on
    high temperatures and pressures to get the atoms of 2 layers to disperse
    into each other to weld them. Ultrasonic welding is where high frequency
    acoustic frequencies are used to melt the materials at the points of contact,
    no adhesive or screws are required. It is commonly used for the joining of thermoplastics.
    Magnetic pulse welding entails using EM pulses to create high density magnetic
    fields in the region to induce a pressure on the materials to join them. Hot
    isostatic materials will use high temperature and isostatic gas pressure to
    go beyond the yield strength of the materials to weld them. Using and
    researching these methods will enable us to fuse similar and dissimilar
    materials together hence allowing cheaper, quicker production of complex
    components which will help achieve nuclear fusion as a commercial reality.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Code">Design Codes</h2>
  <p>
    To take nuclear fusion from research to commercial will require the aid of
    suitably designed codes and standards. Some of the current design standards
    were written decades ago. For example, arc welding is required by some codes
    for the design of nuclear reactors but, as spoken about previously, electron
    beam and laser welding are much more efficient that arc welding. Due to the
    current design specifications in use this mean arc welding will be used
    despite the clear benefits of the alternate methods. At the new UKAEA facility
    in the AMRC design codes and standards will be reviewed to cut down on cost
    of components, in order to produce more efficient, complex and safe components.
		There have been prior reviews to the approach of design specifications, such
		as by the Culham centre for fusion energy (CCFE) which suggests design time
		could be reduced by 4 orders of magnitude.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>
    The <a href="/ITER.html">ITER program</a> uses the AFCEN codes, but to make
    nuclear fusion a commercial reality, many new design codes and specifications
    will need to be developed for these projects to take advantage of new
    technology and manufacturing capabilities.
