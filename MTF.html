		<h1 id="Intro">Magnetized Target Fusion (<strong>MTF</strong>)</h1>
		<p>
			Combining MCF and ICF results in magnetized target fusion. A fusion fuel is
			confined at a lower density by magnetic fields and heated to become plasma.
			Fusion reactions are initiated by rapidly squeezing this fuel target to
			greatly raise the density and temperature. The result is at a far lower density
			than those of ICF and theoretically it will combine longer confinement times
			and better heat retention than the previous two methods.
			<br><br>
			One example of this is General Fusion's MTF reactor<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
			which is comprised of 3 main components. Firstly, the plasma injector turns
			hydrogen fuel into hot plasma confining it in a magnetic field. Next, there
			is a chamber of spinning liquid metal which is used to compress the plasma
			as well as capturing the energy produced by the fusion reactions. A
			compression system is used to pump the liquid metal and form a vortex.
			Finally, a group of pistons are used in order to collapse the vortex,
			compressing the plasma further in the process. These pistons have to strike
			as close as possible to the same time as each other to create a symmetrical
			shockwave to interact with the fuel. To obtain energy from this the liquid
			metal wall is pumped through a heat exchanger to turn a steam turbine similar
			to traditional power plants.

		<h2 id="frc">Field-reversed Configuration (<strong>FRC</strong>)<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></h2>
		<p>
			FRC is used for magnetized target fusion. It is a device which confines
			the plasma on closed magnetic field lines without a central penetration so
			that it is a self-stable torus shape. The plasma is confined in it's own
			magnetic field by inducing a toroidal electric current in a plasma cylinder.
			This method is similar to spheromaks except that they have an internal
			toroidal field. (Spheromaks are essentially a spherical tokamak without a
			central conductor or magnet.) Field-reversed configuration is less prone to
			instabilities in theory but struggles to make a sufficiently dense and
			stable plasma in practice.
		</p>

		<h2 id="issues">Issues with MTF</h2>
		<p>
			Magnetised target fusion has the benefit of combining the advantages of
			internal and magnetic confinement such that fusion becomes more stable and
			easier to attain them individually. On the other hand, the amount of
			secondary or auxiliary systems needed to sustain the reaction, being the
			superconducting magnetic field and laser array needed to fuse the D-T
			mixture, increases. Consequently, the net energy gain needed for
			commercialisation becomes more difficult. It would require the reactor to
			run for long periods, something which is still being worked on in a
			research setting. All the while, the issues of these techniques still need
			to be addressed to improve efficiency, which is discussed further in the
			<a href="./MCF.html">magnetic confinement page</a> and
			<a href="./ICF.html">internal confinement page.</a>
