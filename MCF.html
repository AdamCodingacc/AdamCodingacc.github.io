	<h1 id="Intro">Magnetic Confinement Fusion (<strong>MCF</strong>)</h1>
	<p>
		MCF is the other most common method of fusion and the most highly developed
		currently. <a href="#Tokamak">Tokamaks</a> are the main example in
		current use such as the one being built at <a href="./ITER.html">ITER</a>
		and the one at <a href="./JET.html">JET.</a> MCF uses magnetic fields to
		contain the fuel in the form of a hot plasma. It uses the conductivity of
		plasma to control it through the way it interacts with external magnetic
		fields. Pressure from magnetism is used to counteract that which originates
		from the plasma to try and hold the fuel with as little turbulence and leaking
		effects as possible. There are two main types of MCF reactor: Magnetic mirror
		devices and Toroidal machines.
	</p>
	<h2 id="mag">Magnetic Mirror Devices</h2>
	<p>
		Mirror devices generate non-planar fields generated by solenoids
		in which the strength of the field is raised at either end. As charged particles
		approach either end of the magnetic field they are reflected to keep them
		contained. Unfortunately, particles which are moving too fast along the field
		cannot be stopped by the mirror and escape leading to large leaking effects.
		Sections of plasma can be added at either end past the 'mirror' to reduce the
		leaking via the electrostatic potential barrier they produce. These are called
		end plugs, providing electrostatic plugging. This set up is called a "tandem
		mirror" design but it is not perfect. In fact this design did not prove
		fruitful and little work has been carried out in this field since the 1970s.
	</p>
	<h2 id="toroidal">Toroidal Machines</h2>
	<p>
		Currently, the most popular method are Toroidal machines, of which
		<a href="#Tokamak">Tokamaks</a> are the most widespread example. These
		machines use a variety of set ups to produce a toroidal magnetic field in
		order to contain the plasma fuel.
	</p>

		<h3>Tokamak Reactors</h3>
		<p>
			The term <strong>tokamak</strong> comes from a Russian acronym standing for
			"toroidal chamber with magnetic coils" as this is what comprises the reactor
			(a toroid being a roughly doughnut shaped object.)
			A Tokamak reactor produces energy through fusion which is absorbed into the
			walls and used to produce steam. This steam turns large turbines similar to
			a traditional power plant (<em>e.g. coal-fired power station</em>.)
			<br><br>
			The heart of the reactor is a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber. Inside this
			ring the environment is very hot and under extremely high pressure. Under
			these conditions hydrogen gas becomes a plasma (hot and electrically charged
			gas. <em> This allows light elements to fuse in a star</em>.) Charged plasma
			particles can be altered by large magnetic coils to keep the hot plasma from
			touching the vessel walls.
			<br><br>
			To start with air and other impurites are evacuated from the chamber.
			Magnetic systems which will help with confining and keeping the plasma under
			control are charged up. Gaseous fuel is introduced when the magnets are
			charged up. When the fuel is introduced a very large electrical current
			is run through the vessel causing the hydrogen gas to break down electrically.
			The nuclei lose electrons through ionization to become plasma in the reactor.
			When this plasma becomes energized the individual particles collide and heat
			up.
			<br><br>
			External support methods help heat the plasma to above 150 million Â°C as
			this is the range in which fusion becomes possible. It happens at these
			temperatures because the plasma can now overcome the natural electromagnetic
			repulsion between particles. This allows the particles to fuse on collisions
			to release energy.

	<h3 id="Stellar">Stellarator</h3>
	<p>
	Stellarators are an example of MCF and more specifically a toroidal machine.
	Unlike <a href="#Tokamak">Tokamaks,</a> a stellarator is axially asymmetric
	and should eliminate most of the particle drift which is an issue in tokamaks.
	It does this by using external magnetic coils only creating a negligible
	plasma current. It is comprised of spiralling ribbon shapes which produce
	high-density plasma which is symmetric and more stable than tokamaks allowing
	for a longer running duration. Geometry makes these difficult to build and
	highly sensitive. The original shape was two half Torus shapes so the drift
	up on the inside edge of the tube and down on the outside edge will cancel out.
	There are issues with this however as it can cause collisions hence the
	revised shape.
	</p>

	<h2>Issues with MCF</h2>
	<p>
		The main issue of the magnetic confinement is the containment of the plasma
		using superconducting magnets, hence magnetic confinement. The charged
		particles in the plasma beam experience a Lorentz force as they accelerate
		in a circular direction around the reactor. This force causes them to remain
		in the centre of the vessel, balanced between the inward force of the
		magnetic field and pressure from the plasma pushing back.[britannica]
		<br><br>
		The issue with this is that if the reaction rate is not uniform throughout
		the plasma it can lead to pressure fluctuations and therefore an unstable
		plasma. This can cause quenching of the reaction if it touches the vessel
		walls of the reactor, allowing heat to escape and cause fusion to stop.
		For example, at the <a href="./JET.html">JET fusion reactor</a>, which has
		a plasma density 1 million times less dense than air, it means any small
		change in density of the plasma could become problematic[CCFE]. A solution is
		to use more individual magnets around the reactor and monitor for
		fluctuations of the plasma and calibrate the B field. This comes at an
		energy cost as superconducting magnets need to have temperatures near
		absolute zero, which becomes costly if the reactor is not running continuously.
