	<h1>Tokamak Reactors</h1>
	<p>
		The term <strong>tokamak</strong> comes from a Russian acronym standing for
		"toroidal chamber with magnetic coils" as this is what comprises the reactor.
		(a toroid being a roughly doughnut shaped object.)
		A Tokamak reactor produces energy through fusion which is absorbed into the
		walls and used to produce steam. This steam turns large turbines similar to
		a traditional power plant (<em>e.g. coal-fired power station</em>.)
		<br><br>
		The heart of the reactor is a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber. Inside this
		ring the environment is very hot and under extremely high pressure. Under
		these conditions hydrogen gas becomes a plasma (hot and electrically charged
		gas. <em> This allows light elements to fuse in a star</em>.) Charged plasma
		particles can be altered by large magnetic coils to keep the hot plasma from
		touching the vessel walls.
		<br><br>
		To start with air and other impurites are evacuated from the chamber.
		Magnetic systems which will help with confining and keeping the plasma under
		control are charged up. Gaseous fuel is introduced when the magnets are
		charged up. When the fuel is introduced a very large electrical current
		is run through the vessel causing the hydrogen gas to break down electrically.
		The nuclei lose electrons through ionization to become plasma in the reactor.
		When this plasma becomes energized the individual particles collide and heat
		up.
		<br><br>
		External support methods help heat the plasma to above 150 million Â°C as
		this is the range in which fusion becomes possible. It happens at these
		temperatures because the plasma can now overcome the natural electromagnetic
		repulsion between particles. This allows the particles to fuse on collisions to release energy.
