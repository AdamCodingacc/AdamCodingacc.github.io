		<h2 id="Intro">Inertial Confinement Fusion (<strong>ICF</strong>)</h2>
		<p>
			This type of nuclear fusion attempts to initiate a fusion reaction by heating
			up and compressing a fuel target (in the form of a pellet). These
			pellets will be compressed to incredibly high densities and temperatures
			so that fusion occurs for a short period of time (in the region of nanoseconds)
			until they blow apart.
			To achieve this compression high intensity lasers or
			beams of charged particles (<strong>a driver</strong>) are aimed at the outer layer
			of the target. The heated outer layer will explode, producing a reaction
			force which acts on the remaining fuel. This compresses it via shockwaves which
			are sufficiently powerful to compress and heat the fuel enough for fusion.
			This method of energy delivery can be direct or indirect depending on the
			setup and in its final stages can compress the pellet in the region of
			<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">1000 to 10,000 times the density of a typical solid.</a>
			<br><br>
			Direct delivery is when the laser is shone <em>directly</em> onto the surface
			of the fuel pellet. Indirect drive is when the laser is shone onto another
			object called a hohlraum (a gold cavity) which contains the pellet. It then vaporises bathing
			the fuel in X-rays, compressing it and starting fusion. This method is used
			at NIF (<em>National Ignition Facility</em>), the largest example of an ICF
			currently operational, as it prevents <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.871025">hydrodynamic instability</a>
			by uniform exposure.
			<br><br>

			The fuel target generally consists of a mixture of deuterium and tritium.
			Pellets of fuel are normally around <a href="https://www.iop.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/inertial-confinement-lancaster.pdf">10 mg</a>
			and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement#ref256088">1 to 10 mm in diameter</a>.
			To be efficient the time the pellet is burning must be less than the time for
			disassembly. To have this condition met, <em>compressed pellet mass density x radius</em>
			must be greater than 3 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. This helps because a large mass
			density hastens the burning of the pellet and a larger radius decreases the
			disassembly time. In order to be worthwhile the ratio of energy produced to
			driver energy recquired (<strong>pellet gain</strong>) has to be over
			<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">100.</a>
		</p>

		<h3 id="first"><a href="https://firstlightfusion.com/">First Light Fusion</a></h3>
		<p>
			First light fusion have tried to use a "<em>pistol shrimp mechanism</em>."
			This draws back the hammer part and then snaps to the opposite claw creating
			a rapid pressure change which causes vapor-filled voids in water. These are
			called cavitation bubbles which collapse to produce shock waves. Vapor is
			compressed so forcefully that it causes plasma to form – earth’s only natural
			example of ICF. Plasma formed in this way reaches temperatures of around
			<a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph240/nag2/">4,800 °C.</a>
			First light fusion are trying to use this design for a reactor to be the
			shockwave in ICF. It is intended to trigger the fusion reaction by creation
			of inertially confined plasma.

	<h3 id="NIF">National Ignition Facility (<strong>NIF</strong>)</h3>
	<p>
		The National Ignition Facility is located in the Lawrence Livermore National
		Laboratory in California. The facility carries out experiments to try and
		do a range of things from improving weapon capabilities to other national
		security based applications but its primary objective is nuclear fusion
		ignition. It plans to achieve this through the use of indirectly driven
		ICF. Currently, it attempts to do this by firing 192 laser beams at a hohlraum
		to bathe the fuel suspended inside. In May of 2018 a record 2.15 megajoules <sup><a href="#23">[23]</a></sup>
		of UV energy were fired at the target chamber which is a large improvement on
		the design specification which proved to be less effective than anticipated
		in prior experiments. This set a new record neutron yield which is of the
		order of 21 times the yields when NIF first began experimenting in the 2009.<sup><a href="#26">[26]</a></sup>
		<br><br>
		NIF has encountered many issues in its lifetime which reduce the anticipated
		yield and mean it still remains economically unviable as a method of power
		production. Research at the facility is still very much active with recent
		experiments including research into Liquid-hydrogen fuel <sup><a href="#24">[24]</a></sup>
		and a new "Frustraum" shaped Hohlraum to replace the traditional cylindrical shape.<sup><a href="#25">[25]</a></sup>
	</p>

	<h2 id="issues">Issues with ICF</h2>
	<p>
		As stated previously, the internal confinement method aims to produce a shock
		wave that will compress and heat the inner D-T fuel pellet creating a high
		energy density to initiate fusion. The main issues specific to the internal
		confinement fusion process stem from the need to have nearly perfect fuel
		pellet heating. The requirement with a relatively small target size
		(<em>mm in diameter</em>) against high energy lasers means any asymmetry can
		cause unsuccessful fusion[22]. Sources of the discussed asymmetries include:
		<ul>
			<li>Irregularities in the surface of the outer fuel casing (quantified by the sphericity of the pellet).</li>
			<li>The initial delivery time of the beam on the pellet.</li>
			<li>The energy and intensity of the individual lasers are not equal.</li>
		</ul>
			<br><br>
			The outcome of all these irregularities is that uneven heating of the
			target will, in turn, produce an uneven shock wave leading to lower
			compression forces in the D-T mixture. This is from Rayleigh-Taylor
			instabilities [21], a dynamic fluid process between two fluid components
			(Deuterium and Tritium) minimising their combined potential energy creating
			a turbulent system that causes a reduction in heating efficiency when
			compressed by the shock wave.
			<br><br>
			The above issues are from the direct fuel heating of the fuel. An
			alternative method is indirectly heating the fuel (discussed above). The
			issue with this is a significant portion of the energy input is wasted
			heating the cavity to produce X-rays. Meaning the system's efficiency is
			decreased and making the goal of a net energy gain from the system more
			complicated than direct heating even though it does reduce the issue of
			asymmetric compression of the fuel.
