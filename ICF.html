	<h2>Inertial Confinement Fusion (<strong>ICF</strong>)</h2>
	<p>
		This type of nuclear fusion attempts to initiate a fusion reaction by heating
		up and compressing a fuel target (in the form of a pellet). These
		pellets will be compressed to incredibly high densities and temperatures
		so that fusion occurs for a short period of time (in the region of nanoseconds)
		until they blow apart.
		To achieve this compression high intensity lasers or
		beams of charged particles (<strong>a driver</strong>) are aimed at the outer layer
		of the target. The heated outer layer will explode, producing a reaction
		force which acts on the remaining fuel. This compresses it via shockwaves which
		are sufficiently powerful to compress and heat the fuel enough for fusion.
		This method of energy delivery can be direct or indirect depending on the
		setup and in its final stages can compress the pellet in the region of
		<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">1000 to 10,000 times the density of a typical solid.</a>
		<br><br>
		Direct delivery is when the laser is shone <em>directly</em> onto the surface
		of the fuel pellet. Indirect drive is when the laser is shone onto another
		object called a hohlraum (a gold cavity) which contains the pellet. It then vaporises bathing
		the fuel in X-rays, compressing it and starting fusion. This method is used
		at NIF (<em>National Ignition Facility</em>), the largest example of an ICF
		currently operational, as it prevents <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.871025">hydrodynamic instability</a>
		by uniform exposure.
		<br><br>

		The fuel target generally consists of a mixture of deuterium and tritium.
		Pellets of fuel are normally around <a href="https://www.iop.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/inertial-confinement-lancaster.pdf">10 mg</a>
		and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement#ref256088">1 to 10 mm in diameter</a>.
		To be efficient the time the pellet is burning must be less than the time for
		disassembly. To have this condition met, <em>compressed pellet mass density x radius</em>
		must be greater than 3 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. This helps because a large mass
		density hastens the burning of the pellet and a larger radius decreases the
		disassembly time. In order to be worthwhile the ratio of energy produced to
		driver energy recquired (<strong>pellet gain</strong>) has to be over
		<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor/Mirror-confinement">100.</a>

	<h3>Issues with ICF</h3>
	<p>
	</p>
	<h3><a href="https://firstlightfusion.com/">First Light Fusion</a></h3>
	<p>
		First light fusion have tried to use a "<em>pistol shrimp mechanism</em>."
		This draws back the hammer part and then snaps to the opposite claw creating
		a rapid pressure change which causes vapor-filled voids in water. These are
		called cavitation bubbles which collapse to produce shock waves. Vapor is
		compressed so forcefully that it causes plasma to form – earth’s only natural
		example of ICF. Plasma formed in this way reaches temperatures of around
		<a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph240/nag2/">4,800 °C.</a>
		First light fusion are trying to use this design for a reactor to be the
		shockwave in ICF. It is intended to trigger the fusion reaction by creation
		of inertially confined plasma.
