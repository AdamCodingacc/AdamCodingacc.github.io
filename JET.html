	<h1>JET</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Joint European Torus (JET) is a burning plasma experiment (BPX) trialling
		magnetic confinement at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. The reactor was
		built initially with the aim of a gain of 1 (i.e. Q-factor=1) [1]. Operation
		commenced in 1983 and by the early 90’s JET became the world’s first reactor
		to be fuelled by a 50:50 mix of tritium and deuterium (DT). By 1997, JET
		achieved a gain of Q=0.67
		<br><br>
		The main objectives of JET [2] were to study:
		<ol>
			<li>Plasma processes and scaling laws into regions close to those needed in a thermonuclear reactor.</li>
			<li>Behaviour of energetic alpha particles produced by DT reactions.</li>
			<li>Methods of heating the plasma to temperatures at which the energy in fusion would sustain the plasma.</li>
			<li>Plasma interactions with the torus walls - effects of impurities from the walls on the plasma & wall lifetime are unknown.</li>
			<li>General factors such as plasma startup and plasma shaping.</li>
		</ol>

		The total construction cost of the JET reactor was 100,000,000 UC [3]
		(1UC=50 Belgian Francs at that time) The D-shaped cross-section was
		associated with a higher plasma current for a given safety factor, but the
		relationship between confinement time and plasma current had not yet been
		demonstrated. JET was foreseen to be built in 5 years.
		<br><br>
		The main objective was divided into 4 sections [4]: confinement, plasma
		heating, impurities produced during the plasma heating and interaction with
		the walls, and alpha particle behaviour/alpha confinement. The idea of JET
		initially skewed far from other laboratories’ designs - the size was much
		larger than expected (see Figure 1); it had a feedback-controlled vertical
		field instead of a stabilizing shell; and it had a D-shaped cross-section as
		opposed to a circular one. The total duration of the plasma discharge had
		been extended to 20 seconds at a toroidal field of 3.4T. JET is still in
		operation 32 years after its first deuterium-tritium (DT) plasma was created
		for the confinement of alpha particles.

		The European Fusion programme aims to implement the use of JET in Horizon
		2020 as the main risk-mitigation element for the preparation of ITER [5]. In
		2004, the programme in support of ITER was launched consisting of 3 main
		elements: installation of ITER-like wall; development of ITER-like plasma;
		and DT experiments to test the fuel mix of ITER. The ITER-like wall has been
		completed (2016). In 2013-14, JET achieved plasma currents up to 4MA,
		magnetic fields up to 3.7T and auxiliary power up to 27MW. The failures of
		JET led to the international contribution to ITER where there is an expected
		gain of 50 (Q-factor=50) [4].
		<br><br>
		Upon exiting the European Union the UK will no longer be a member of the
		Euratom Research and Training programme or a member of Fusion for Energy [6].
		The UK will not be able to work through the EU on the ITER project. JET
		operations will continue at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy until the
		end of 2020.
